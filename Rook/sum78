# In this part of the session, you will be solving the following problem:
# Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 7 and extending to the next 8 (every 7 will be followed by at least one 8). Return 0 for no numbers.

# sum78([1, 2, 2]) → 5
# sum78([1, 2, 2, 7, 99, 99, 8]) → 5
# sum78([1, 1, 7, 8, 2]) → 4

def sum78(nums):
    total_sum = 0
    in_section = False

    for num in nums:
        if num == 7:
            in_section = True
        elif num == 8 and in_section:
            in_section = False
        elif not in_section:
            total_sum += num
    return total_sum
