# In this part of the session, you will be solving the following problem:
# Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array. 

# biggest_diff([10, 3, 5, 6]) â†’ 7
# biggest_diff([7, 2, 10, 9]) â†’ 8
# biggest_diff([2, 10, 7, 2]) â†’ 8
