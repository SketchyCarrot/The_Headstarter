# In this task, you are required to generate a new array that is twice the length of an initial integer array 'nums' with a length of 'n'.
# The new array, dubbed 'ans', should be constructed such that the first half of 'ans' directly replicates the 'nums' array, and the second half is a repetition of the first, thereby doubling the sequence.
# Essentially, for each element with index 'i' in 'nums', 'ans[i] = nums[i]' and 'ans[i + n] = nums[i]', with 'i' ranging from 0 to 'n-1'.
 
# Your objective is to return the array 'ans' thus obtained.
 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,1]
# Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]
# Explanation: The resulting 'ans' array combines 'nums' with itself, yielding [1,2,1,1,2,1].
 
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1,3,2,1]
# Output: [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]
# Explanation: Similarly, the 'ans' array is formed by concatenating 'nums' with itself, resulting in [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1].
 
# Constraints:
# - The length of 'nums' ('n') is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
# - Each element in 'nums' can be any integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
