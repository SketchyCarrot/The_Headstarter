# Given three ints, a b c, one of them is small, one is medium and one is large. 
# Return true if the three values are evenly spaced, so the difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large.

# evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) → true
# evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) → true
# evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) → false
